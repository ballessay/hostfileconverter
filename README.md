# HostFileConverter

Converts and combines hosts files from different sources to one file. My use case is to block a bunch of domains on DNS level so I don't need a browser extension.

## Usage

Download files in hosts format from different sources (for example see: DownloadHostFiles.sh)

`./HostFileConverter.py -h`
